### 𝐇𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞, 𝐟𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰 <𝚍𝚎𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚘𝚙𝚎𝚛𝚜/>!     👋

I graduated from the mathematics department. I love programming, music and always want to learn new things. 
I am currently interested in data mining methods and methodologies as well as django. 
I have worked on many projects in this field. I have extensively used classification and clustering operations with machine learning algorithms. 
On the one hand, I continue to do my own projects in Django. I continue to improve myself. 
If you think something could be better, please feel free to clone/fork projects, raise issues, and post PR.
